# E-commerce Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the e-commerce online store with the pharmacy management system, creating a complete end-to-end solution for online ordering and inventory management.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Inventory Synchronization
- **Real-time sync**: E-commerce store now reads inventory directly from the first pharmacy's stock
- **Automatic updates**: Inventory data syncs every 30 seconds between systems
- **Product filtering**: Only suitable products (non-controlled, non-refrigerated) appear in online store
- **Stock validation**: Real-time stock checking prevents overselling

### 2. Product Mapping
- **Category mapping**: Pharmacy categories automatically mapped to e-commerce categories
- **Product descriptions**: Auto-generated user-friendly descriptions based on pharmacy data
- **Icon assignment**: Appropriate FontAwesome icons based on product type
- **Prescription detection**: Automatic identification of prescription-required items

### 3. Order Processing Integration

### 4. Stock Validation
- **Pre-order validation**: Stock checked before order submission
- **Cart validation**: Shopping cart items validated against current inventory
- **Error notifications**: Clear error messages for stock issues
- **Automatic cart updates**: Cart refreshed when stock changes
