# Standalone Mode Implementation Summary

## Issue Resolved
The online store was showing "standalone mode" when accessed directly via `file:///D:/Ahmed%20Private/VIVALIFE/Dispensing%20System/VivaLife/online-store/index.html` because it wasn't connected to the main pharmacy system.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Smart Mode Detection**
- **Integrated Mode**: When pharmacy system data is available in localStorage
- **Standalone Mode**: When running independently without pharmacy system

### 2. **Enhanced Product Loading** (`online-store/js/products.js`)
- **Integrated Mode**: Loads products from pharmacy inventory (`pharmacy_products`)
- **Standalone Mode**: Falls back to comprehensive sample product catalog
- Added `currentStock` and `sku` properties to sample products for compatibility

### 3. **Improved Stock Validation** (`online-store/js/cart.js`)
- **Integrated Mode**: Validates against real pharmacy inventory
- **Standalone Mode**: Validates against product catalog stock levels
- Graceful fallback when pharmacy data is unavailable

### 4. **Flexible Checkout Process** (`online-store/js/checkout.js`)
- **Integrated Mode**: 
  - Validates stock against pharmacy inventory
  - Saves orders to pharmacy system localStorage keys
  - Triggers events for pharmacy system integration
- **Standalone Mode**:
  - Validates stock against product catalog
  - Saves orders to standalone localStorage key
  - Works independently without pharmacy system

### 5. **Connection Status Indicator** (`online-store/js/main.js`)
- Shows visual indicator of connection status
- Green badge: "Connected to Pharmacy" (integrated mode)
- Yellow badge: "Standalone Mode" (independent operation)

## Key Features in Standalone Mode

✅ **Full Product Catalog**: 15+ sample products across all categories

✅ **Stock Management**: Real-time stock checking and validation  
✅ **Checkout Process**: Complete order placement with customer details  
✅ **Order Management**: Orders saved locally for demonstration

✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of stock issues  

## Sample Products Available in Standalone Mode

## How It Works

### Standalone Mode Flow:

4. **Shopping**: User can browse and add products to cart
5. **Validation**: Stock validated against product catalog
6. **Checkout**: Orders processed and saved locally
7. **Confirmation**: Order confirmation with tracking number

### Integration Mode Flow:
1. **Access**: User opens via pharmacy system or with pharmacy data
2. **Detection**: System detects pharmacy inventory data
3. **Sync**: Loads real products from pharmacy inventory
4. **Shopping**: Real-time stock validation against pharmacy
5. **Integration**: Orders sync with pharmacy management system
6. **Processing**: Orders appear in pharmacy's online orders section

## Benefits
- **Flexibility**: Works both standalone and integrated
